## Clinical Trial Attrition in Neuorpsychiatric Clinical Trials Using Machine Intelligence

### Introduction
Clinical trial participation retention directly affects the generalizability and validity of the results of that trial. The primary goal of this notebook is to use a data driven approach to investigate the predictive features leading to patient attrition in Bipolar clinical trials. The data source is aggregated at the trial level. 

#### Bipolar
Create list of nct_ids that have some form of "bipolar" listed as downcase_name of the study from the conditions table. Found 1,383 studies that matched the syntax below.  

##### Method for getting bipolar studies :  
  - Table : ctgov.conditions   
  - Column : downcase_name  
    - Strings Pulled : 'bipolar'  
    
###### Bipolar study key method
```{sql connection=con}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bipolar_study_key_V2;
```

```{sql connection=con}
WITH bipolar_studies AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM ctgov.conditions 
  WHERE downcase_name LIKE '%bipolar%'
  ), enrollment_info AS ( 
    SELECT studies.nct_id, SUM(enrollment) AS enrollment_total
    FROM ctgov.studies
    GROUP BY nct_id
 ), dropout_info AS (
    SELECT drop_withdrawals.nct_id, SUM(count) AS drop_count_total
    FROM ctgov.drop_withdrawals
    GROUP BY nct_id
 )
SELECT bipolar_studies.nct_id, enrollment_total, drop_count_total
INTO TEMP bipolar_study_key_V2
FROM bipolar_studies 
LEFT JOIN enrollment_info
ON bipolar_studies.nct_id = enrollment_info.nct_id
LEFT JOIN dropout_info
ON bipolar_studies.nct_id = dropout_info.nct_id
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nct_id)
FROM bipolar_study_key_V2;
```    

## create table with ae nct_ids, subject_count, and ids for creating adverse events table
```{sql connection=con, output.var="bipolar_ae_key"}
WITH bipolar_studies AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM ctgov.conditions 
  WHERE downcase_name LIKE '%bipolar%'
  ), reported_events AS (
    SELECT reported_events.nct_id, reported_events.subjects_affected, reported_events.id
    FROM ctgov.reported_events
 )
SELECT bipolar_studies.nct_id, reported_events.id, subjects_affected
FROM bipolar_studies 
LEFT JOIN reported_events
ON bipolar_studies.nct_id = reported_events.nct_id;
```

```{r}
write.csv(bipolar_ae_key, "/Users/nataliecortopassi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/510 - HIDS/Adverse Events/ae_key_dfs/bipolar_ae_key.csv")
```    

##### Create Seperate events table with counts per event type

      - subjects_affected (count_event_subjects) *calculated by adding all values grouped by nct_id and event_type*
          - Number of subjects affected by the event
```{sql connection=con}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bipolar_event_table;
```

```{sql connection=con}
WITH event_info AS (
    SELECT reported_event_totals.nct_id, reported_event_totals.event_type, SUM(subjects_affected) AS subjects_affected_total
    FROM ctgov.reported_event_totals
    GROUP BY nct_id, event_type
 ), bipolar_key AS ( 
    SELECT bipolar_study_key_V2.nct_ID
    FROM bipolar_study_key_V2
)
 SELECT bipolar_key.nct_id, subjects_affected_total, event_type
 INTO TEMP bipolar_event_table
 FROM bipolar_key 
 LEFT JOIN event_info
 ON bipolar_key.nct_id = event_info.nct_id
``` 

```{sql connection=con, output.var="bipolar_event_table"}
SELECT * 
FROM bipolar_event_table;
```

```{r}
write.csv(bipolar_event_table, "/Users/nataliecortopassi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/510 - HIDS/bipolar_df/bipolar_event_table.csv")
```
